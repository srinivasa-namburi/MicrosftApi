These files are sample "Bring Your Own Data" files which describe a specific reactor. They are seeded here to mimic the internal documents a company may wish to add to the training set for this Generative AI solution to improve the quality of the output of the system. The files were created by UC Berkeley, and are accessible here: https://fhr.nuc.berkeley.edu/pb-fhr-technology/ . These files are not intended to be used in a production deployment, but are to help users understand how a company's own custom data can be brought into the training set for the solution to improve it's performance.
