It applies to the Generative AI Copilot for Small Modular Reactors (SMR) Licensing Solution Accelerator which is Microsoft pre-release beta code or pre-release technology and provided to you at no charge (“Software Code”). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THE TERMS IN THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING OR ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE CODE, YOU ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO COMPLY WITH THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE CODE. 
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
a)	General. Microsoft grants you a nonexclusive, perpetual, royalty-free right to use, copy, and modify the Software Code. You may not redistribute or sublicense the Software Code or any use of it (except to your affiliates and to vendors to perform work on your behalf) through network access, service agreement, lease, rental, or otherwise. Unless applicable law gives you more rights, Microsoft reserves all other rights not expressly granted herein, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. 
b)	Improvements. 
i)	Microsoft shall exclusively own all right, title, and interest in and to any modifications, enhancements, improvements to, and derivative works of the Software Code that Microsoft or Customer creates (“Improvements”), and such Improvements will be deemed included within the definition of Software Code under this Agreement.
ii)	 As between Microsoft and Customer, Customer will exclusively own all rights, title, and interest in and to any pre-existing Customer solution, code, model (including model instance fine-tuned using Customer’s confidential data) (“Customer Pre-Existing Work”), as well as any modifications and derivative works of such Customer Pre-Existing Work developed by Customer under this Agreement. 
iii)	 As between Microsoft and Customer, Customer will exclusively own all rights, title, and interest in and to any improvements, enhancements or technologies built on top of the Software Code created by the Customer for the purposes of providing a solution layer for Customer’s clients (the “Solution Layer”). For clarity, the (a) Solution Layer does not include the Software Code or the Microsoft Improvements; and (b) any improvements, modifications or derivative works made to the Software Code that are not created to provide the Solution Layer will be Microsoft Improvements.
