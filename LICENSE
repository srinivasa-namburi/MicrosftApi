GENERATIVE AI FOR PERMITTING SOLUTION ACCELERATOR EARLY ACCESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These Generative AI for Permitting Solution Accelerator Early Access Terms and Conditions ("Agreement") are an agreement between the party receiving access to the Software Code (such party, "you" or "Customer") and Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft"). This Agreement governs the technology and software code currently known as the Microsoft "Generative AI for Permitting Solution Accelerator" (as such name may be updated by Microsoft from time to time), which is Microsoft pre-release beta technology and code (the "Software Code"). The Software Code is provided to you at no cost, subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS DESCRIBED BELOW. BY USING OR ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE CODE, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT


1.	USE RIGHTS.
a)	Use Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Microsoft grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable, perpetual right to access and use, but not to distribute or otherwise transfer, the Software Code solely for your internal business purposes and for developing and using Customer Solutions.
b)	Third-Party Components. The Software Code may include or reference third-party components (i.e., open-source components) that are governed by separate agreements or to which separate legal notices apply, as may be described in third-party notice file(s) accompanying the Software Code. Your use of any such third-party components will be governed by the terms of the separate agreements and legal notices, if any, that are applicable to such use. 
c)	Customer Solutions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Customer may build, or may engage other parties to build, solutions (each, a "Customer Solution") that may use the Software Code or may run on or interoperate with the Software Code in connection with other Azure Services.

2.	USE RESTRICTIONS. 
a)	General. You will not (and will not attempt to): (i) use the Software Code in any way that violates any applicable laws, rules, regulations, or governmental orders or decrees; (ii) use the Software Code in any application or situation where such use could lead to the death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage; (iii) use the Software Code to violate the rights of others or to create or propagate any malware or other malicious code or software; (iv) reverse engineer or work around any technical limitations in the Software Code; (v) use the Software Code to try to gain unauthorized access to or to disrupt any service, device, data, account, or network; (vi) share, publish, distribute, transfer, lend, or provide the Software Code, or access to the Software Code, to any third party (except to your employees and contractors that require access to the Software Code to perform work on your behalf under this Agreement); (vii) use the Software Code in a way that could harm Microsoft's IT systems or impair anyone else's use of them; (viii) use the Software Code except as permitted under this Agreement; or (ix) permit, assist or encourage anyone to do any of the above.  
b)	Assumption of Risk. You assume all risks associated with your use of the Software Code, including all risks associated with any violation of Section 2(a). You are responsible for your employees' and contractors' access to and use of the Software Code in accordance with this Agreement.

3.	PRE-RELEASE TECHNOLOGY. The Software Code is pre-release technology. It may not operate correctly or at all. Microsoft provides no performance guarantee for any Software Code. Microsoft makes no guarantees that the Software Code will be made into a commercially available product or offering. You must exercise your sole discretion in determining whether and how to use the Software Code and are solely responsible for all such use, including all controls, quality assurance, legal, regulatory, and standards compliance associated with such use. 

4.	MICROSOFT AZURE SERVICES. Your use of any Microsoft Azure products or services (collectively and as applicable, "Azure Services") in connection with the Software Code will continue to be governed by the separate agreements and privacy policies associated with your subscription to the Azure Services. Nothing in this Agreement will serve to supersede, amend, or modify any terms in any such separate agreements or policies or to terminate any such separate agreements or policies.

5.	SUPPORT. Microsoft is not obligated under this Agreement to provide any support services related to the Software Code, and this Agreement does not apply to any Microsoft consulting or support services (including paid-for services) that are provided by Microsoft under any separate agreements. Microsoft may provide certain limited support services to help facilitate your use and evaluation of the Software Code, upon request and in its sole discretion. The provision of any such support services provided to you by Microsoft will be as agreed upon by the parties. Further, the Software Code is not included in any service level agreement or other commitments provided by Microsoft. Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, provide certain maintenance, technical support, or updates to the Software Code during the Term. If Microsoft provides any updates to the Software Code, you must use only such updated versions of the Software Code. 

6.	TERM AND TERMINATION. The term of this Agreement will continue until terminated by a party pursuant to this Section 6 (the "Term"). Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by providing at least five (5) business days' prior written notice to the other party. Upon any termination of this Agreement, Customer may continue to exercise its rights under the license granted in Section 1(a).  For the avoidance of doubt, Microsoft will not provide any updates or support related to the Software Code after the effective date of termination of this Agreement. The following sections of the Agreement will survive the expiration and any termination of this Agreement: Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (last three sentences only), and 7-15, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

7.	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
a)	In relation to any Confidential Information received or obtained in connection with this Agreement, each party will: (i) treat that Confidential Information as strictly confidential; (ii) only use the Confidential Information for the purpose for which it was disclosed to that party under this Agreement, and will not use, disclose, or copy the Confidential Information for any other purpose; (iii) only disclose the Confidential Information to persons on a need-to-know basis, and will ensure that each such person will comply with confidentiality provisions no less protective than those contained in this Agreement and remain fully responsible for any such person; (iv) keep all Confidential Information secure and will treat the Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it treats its own confidential information; and (v) inform the disclosing party immediately upon becoming aware, or having reasonable grounds to suspect, that there has been unauthorized access to the Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" means non-public information that is designated "confidential" or "proprietary" or that a reasonable person should understand is confidential given the circumstances of disclosure. For the avoidance of doubt, the Software Code constitutes the Confidential Information of Microsoft.
b)	The provisions of this Section 7 will not prohibit disclosure or use of Confidential Information (if any) to the extent: (i) it becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) it is independently developed by the receiving party; (iii) it is already in the possession of the receiving party and is not subject to any obligation of confidentiality or a restriction on use; or (iv) the disclosing party has given prior written approval of the disclosure or use.
c)	A party may disclose the other party's Confidential Information if required by law or legal process, but only after it notifies the other party (if legally permissible) to enable the other party to seek a protective order or otherwise limit the scope of disclosure.
d)	Neither party is required to restrict work assignments of its representatives who have had access to Confidential Information. Each party agrees that the use of information retained in the unaided memories of a party's representatives in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement does not create liability under this Agreement or trade secret law, and each party agrees to limit what it discloses to the other accordingly.

8.	PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
a)	Ownership of the Customer Solution. Customer retains ownership of all right, title, and interest in the Customer Solution, including all intellectual property rights therein, but excluding all Software Code, Improvements, Microsoft Confidential Information, and other Microsoft products, services, technologies, and intellectual property rights incorporated or embedded therein.

d)	Feedback. Customer may, at its discretion, provide Microsoft with suggestions, comments, input, recommendations, ideas, and other feedback regarding the Software Code and other Microsoft products, services, and offerings ("Feedback").
