# Azure DevOps Environment Configuration Sample
# Copy this file and customize for your environment:
# cp build/environment-variables-ADO-sample.yml build/environment-variables-ADO-dev.yml

environment:
  name: dev  # ADO environment name for deployment gates and approvals

variableGroup:
  name: greenlight-modern-dev  # ADO variable group name - will be created by bootstrap script
  variables:
    AZURE_SERVICE_CONNECTION: "Azure-Greenlight-Dev"               # Name of Azure Resource Manager service connection
    AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Replace with your Azure subscription ID
    AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP: "rg-greenlight-dev"                      # Resource group for deployment
    AZURE_LOCATION: "eastus"                                       # Azure region (eastus, westus2, usgovvirginia, etc.)

    AKS_NAMESPACE: "greenlight-dev"                                # Kubernetes namespace for deployment
    HELM_RELEASE: "greenlight-dev"                                 # Helm release name (should match environment)
    ENVIRONMENT_NAME: "dev"                                        # Must match ADO environment name above

    # KUBERNETES_RESOURCES_CONFIG: Kubernetes resource requests/limits and autoscaling configuration
    # IMPORTANT: This variable MUST be added manually in ADO Library > Variable Groups after running bootstrap
    # The bootstrap script cannot handle complex multiline JSON due to Azure CLI limitations
    #
    # Recommended production configuration (adapt based on your workload):
    # - API Main: 3-8 replicas, 500m CPU / 1GB RAM per pod
    # - Silo (Orleans): 3-10 replicas, 2-4 CPU / 2-4GB RAM per pod (higher for background processing)
    # - Web DocGen: 1-3 replicas, 250m CPU / 256-512MB RAM per pod
    # - MCP Server: 1 replica only (does not scale horizontally), 250m CPU / 256-512MB RAM per pod
    # - DB Setup Manager: Job (no autoscaling, single instance), 250m CPU / 256-512MB RAM
    #
    # To add this variable in ADO:
    # 1. Go to Pipelines > Library > Variable Groups > <your-variable-group-name>
    # 2. Click "+ Add" to create a new variable
    # 3. Name: KUBERNETES_RESOURCES_CONFIG

# Additional variables that can be added to the variable group:
# MEMORY_BACKEND: "aisearch"              # aisearch (default) or postgres
# DEPLOYMENT_MODEL: "public"              # public, private, or hybrid
# ENABLE_AZURE_SIGNALR: "true"           # true (default) or false
# AKS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"  # Optional override if AKS cluster lives in a different subscription
#
# For private/hybrid networking mode, also add:
# AZURE_SUBNET_AKS: "/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet}/subnets/snet-aks"
#   Purpose: Dedicated subnet for AKS cluster nodes (required for hybrid/private mode)
#   IMPORTANT: This subnet must NOT have any delegation configured. AKS will fail with SubnetIsDelegated error.
#   Example: "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg-network/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-greenlight/subnets/snet-aks"
#
# AZURE_SUBNET_PE: "/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet}/subnets/snet-pe"
#   Purpose: Subnet for private endpoints of Azure PaaS services (SQL, Redis, Storage, etc.)
#   Note: No delegation required for this subnet
#   Example: "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg-network/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-greenlight/subnets/snet-pe"
#
# AZURE_SUBNET_POSTGRES: "/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/{vnet}/subnets/snet-postgres"
#   Purpose: Delegated subnet for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (only if using postgres backend)
#   IMPORTANT: This subnet MUST be delegated to Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers
#   Example: "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg-network/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-greenlight/subnets/snet-postgres"
#
# POSTGRES_DNSZONE_RESOURCEID: "/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com"
#   Purpose: Resource ID of private DNS zone for PostgreSQL (only if using postgres backend in private/hybrid mode)
#   Note: DNS zones often reside in a different subscription (hub subscription in hub-spoke architecture)
#
# AKS_PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE: "/subscriptions/{id}/resourceGroups/{rg}/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.{region}.azmk8s.io"
#   Purpose: Resource ID of private DNS zone for AKS private clusters (only needed when creating private AKS clusters)
#   Example: "/subscriptions/hub-sub-id/resourceGroups/rg-dns-hub/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.swedencentral.azmk8s.io"
#   Note: One zone per region. Often in hub subscription. Leave unset to use system-managed DNS zones (not recommended for production)

# REQUIRED secrets to be added manually in ADO after bootstrap:
# PVICO_ENTRA_CREDENTIALS: JSON from '.\build\scripts\sp-create.ps1' script (REQUIRED for authentication)
#   Format: {"TenantId": "87654321-4321-4321-4321-210987654321", "ClientId": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012", "Scopes": "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default", "ClientSecret": "<SECRET>"}
#   Example with placeholders: {"TenantId": "<YOUR-TENANT-ID>", "ClientId": "<YOUR-APP-CLIENT-ID>", "Scopes": "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default", "ClientSecret": "<SECRET>"}
#   Note: This is REQUIRED for the application to function. Run .\build\scripts\sp-create.ps1 to generate these credentials.
#
# OPTIONAL secrets that can be configured post-deployment or added to ADO:
# PVICO_AZUREMAPS_KEY: Azure Maps API key (optional - can be configured post-deployment)
#   Format: "your-azure-maps-key-here"
#   Example: "<SECRET>"
#   Note: Can be left empty initially and configured later via Configuration UI at /admin/configuration?section=secrets
#   The application will start without Azure Maps features until configured
#
# PVICO_OPENAI_CONNECTIONSTRING: Azure OpenAI connection string (optional - can be configured post-deployment)
#   Format: "Endpoint=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/;Key=<SECRET>"
#   Example: "Endpoint=https://my-openai.openai.azure.com/;Key=<SECRET>"
#   Note: Can be left empty initially and configured later via Configuration UI at /admin/configuration?section=secrets
#   The application will start without OpenAI features until configured
#
# HOSTNAME_OVERRIDE: JSON for custom domains (optional)
#   Format: {"WebApplicationUrl": "https://myapp.example.com", "ApiBaseUrl": "https://api.myapp.example.com"}

# Note: Complex JSON variables should be added manually in ADO Library > Variable Groups
# after running the bootstrap script, as YAML cannot represent the required escaping properly.
